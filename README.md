# SCION
## Spatial Continuous Integration - Earth Evolution Model

### Current version v1.1.6 - March 2023

SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that runs over geological timescales. It runs forwards in time and computes the Earthâ€™s major elemental cycles and surface climate. It also predicts the values of a suite of geochemical tracers to aid in hypothesis testing. 

Requies MATLAB. 

For more information on model derivation and running the model, see the Guidebook in the documentation folder.

This code is free to use. The model is under continual revision/extension by my research group and collaborators. For any queries or collaboration ideas please email b.mills@leeds.ac.uk
